# What is this?

So, the other week, I was writing a problem for the class that I was TA'ing, and I needed to get the spliced transcript of GAPDH so students could write a script to translate it to an amino acid sequence, but that's beside the point. So anyways, I popped on over to NCBI and typed "GAPDH" into the search bar, and I clicked on the first thing that showed up. It was the NCBI Gene page for GAPDH which made sense, but it quickly became too complicated to look for a transcript. And even when I did, it took me somewhere else, and I wasn't sure if it was like pre-mRNA or spliced or just the CDS or what.

I got really frustrated and made this. It uses sequence information from the **GRCh38.p14 assembly** of the human genome and annotations from **NCBI's RefSeq** to provide a simple interface to look up genes, transcripts, and their sequences. There's also a random gene button that's fun to use.
